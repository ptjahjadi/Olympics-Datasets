# Olympic Dataset Retrieval using a Binary Search Tree
## Aim
This project aims to create a program to retrieve information from a dataset of Olympic athletes using a binary search tree. 
## Summary
This project is used to assess the effectiveness of binary search trees, and its implementation in C. The project involves storing the data retrieved from a dataset in the form of a binary search tree, making data retrieval possible by traversing the binary search tree. Binary search trees are proven to be reliable in retrieving data by implementing C code to traverse the tree.

The project is personally also the first step in demonstrating competency using GitHub, such as committing and uploading files to a repository using the Git command line.  
## Guide
The project is divided into two stages:
* Stage 1 involves developing a binary search tree using insertion and search functions.
* Stage 2 involves extending the binary search tree theory and developing a linked list for each node in the binary search to handle duplicate data.

.o, .h and makefiles are included within the project.
