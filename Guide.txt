Stage 1: Make a binary search tree that contains ID, name, sex, etc.
Maximum field length 128 chars
Maximum record length 512 chars

After making the BST, search the BST for records

3 files:
datafile = The input file that contains the elements such as the IDs, Sexs, Ages, etc.
outputfile = The output file which is shown in the Example Output (output the ID, Sex, Age, Height, etc.)
keyfile = The search key, which is the one that we want to search in the BST.

Also, printf the number of comparisons required to find the search key
For example if we have 5 keys,

        Ben
    Alice   Ricky
Aby       Gilbert

And if we want to find Gilbert, then the number of comparisons is 3

Note that the search keys are also NOT UNIQUE. Which means, if we find duplicates, like Cornelia Aalten, then we need to find duplicates
of Cornelia Aalten. 

For example, if there is another Gilbert below Gilbert on the example search tree, then we have to output both of them AND
make the total number of comparisons 4.
